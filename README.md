# MarioBaseProject
As a part of my University course, to advance my C++ knowledge I was tasked to build the original Mario arcade game using the SDL library. This build has two levels that are playable, as well as multiplayer capabilities.
Overall this project was a lot of fun to work on, and helped me further my skills in C++, as well as teaching me better development practices.
